# Asset Pricing Theory â€” Problem Set 3

## Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for Problem Set 3 in the Asset Pricing Course (PhD 404) at the Stockholm School of Economics, Spring 2025. The work, conducted by [Ali Bahrami Sani](https://www.hhs.se/sv/persons/b/bahrami-sani-ali/) and [Alfred Bornefalk](https://www.hhs.se/sv/persons/b/bornefalk-alfred/), closely follows Fama and French's procedure for evaluating asset pricing models.

## Note
The code includes a `load_env()` command at the beginning to set up a connection to WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services). To run the code from scratch, you will need your own WRDS credentials for data access.
